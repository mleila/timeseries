# Introduction
This repository provides a high-level overview of modern techniques for time series analysis and Forecasting. Jupyter Notebooks will be used to explain concepts and show code and visualizations. I also developed an accompanying core library `ts` to provide useful functionality in a modular and systematic way to all notebooks.

# Installation
You can install the core library by cloning this repository and then following these steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mleila/timeseries
cd timeseries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the core library in your virtualenv and you'll be able to run the notebooks. Make sure you are using `Python 3` (preferably 3.7).

# Guide
The notebooks are divided into the following three categories
